          <h2>Why this site?</h2>
          <p>This site is created to provide bitcoin users with a way to create <span class="b">perfectly secure offline addresses</span>.
          </p>
          <p>Almost all existing programs for generating bitcoin addresses aren't using truly random source of numbers to constructing private keys, but are instead using pseudorandom numbers which exposes users to security risks - for more information read below.
          </p>
          <p>This site <span class="b">solves this problem</span> by generating truly random numbers from user's mouse movements.
          </p>
          <h2>What is offline address?</h2>
          <p>Offline address is a public address whose private key never existed on a computer that's connected to the internet. 
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom">Today's computers can be attacked and hacked in a lot of ways. By never storing address on a computer while it's connected to the internet, user can be sure that there is no way address could have been stolen. That's why this site will warn the user if he attempts to create bitcoin addresses while connected to the internet.
          </p>
          <p>Offline addresses can be used as <span class="i">saving accounts</span> - user can send bitcoins to his address, while keeping his private key offline.
          </p>
          <a name="security-risk"></a>
          <h2 id="securityrisk">Serious security risk when generating private keys using bad randomness!</h2>
          <div class="prominent">
          <p>There is a serious security problem when generating bitcoin private keys and corresponding addresses using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness#Cryptography">pseudorandom numbers</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom">To make sure your bitcoins are secure, you have to store them on an address that was created with <span class="b">truly random</span> private key.
          </p>
          <p>The private key is basically a big random number - what makes it secure is the fact that it's hard to guess it, because there is a huge number of valid private keys. Chances that someone else runs into your private key are very small (they could be using all computers in the world for their whole life, and the chance to run into your private key would still be negligible).
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom"><span class="b">The problems</span> appear if your private key isn't really random.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom">If you create your private key using pseudorandom numbers (and most wallet software today still use pseudorandom numbers, although security experts strongly advise against it), one small part of the key is random, and the rest is computed from that small first part, and isn't random. Resulting with the fact that only small limited subset of all possible valid private keys can be generated that way. 
          </p>
          <p>Someone can try generating all private keys from that small subset of private keys, and he'd be able to do that relatively fast (within just a few days), after which he'd be able to spend bitcoins from addresses tied to those private keys.
          </p>
          <p>This site doesn't have this problem because all 256 bits needed to create each private key are provided from truly random numbers generated by shaking your mouse. Meaning that those private keys don't belong to any limited set of private keys - which makes them as secure as possible.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom smaller">
          There is total of <span class="b">115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337</span> possible valid private keys. This site is capable of generating <span class="b">any of those private keys</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom smaller">
          If you're using private keys generated from standard pseudorandom sequence of numbers generated in programming languages like C or C++, the total possible number of private keys that can be generated that way is: <span class="b">4294967296</span> (if you're using programs written in Java, the number is: <span class="b">281474976710656</span>).
          </p>
          <p class="smaller">The bigger the number of possible private keys from which your key was created - the lower is the chance that someone will run into your private key.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom smaller">
          Truly random numbers can't be generated inside a software, because there is no way software can roll a physical dice. That's why most application use pseudorandom numbers generated using algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">LDG</a>, which are simple mathematical equations that define how to compute next pseudorandom number from previous pseudorandom number (and those equations are well known).
          </p>
          <p class="smaller">Truly random numbers have to be provided to the software. That's why this site uses data from user's mouse to provide randomness. Dots flying around the screen represent real data collected from user's mouse, which is used to generate truly random private keys.
          </p>
          <p class="remove-bottom">Pseudorandom numbers shouldn't be used inside applications where security is critical. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness#Cryptography">this</a> explanation.
          </p>
          <p>However, most bitcoin wallets today use pseudorandom numbers anyway. If your favorite wallet doesn't generate secure addresses (check their site to see if they mention mouse movements or other human provided input as source of randomness), please contact them, and explain the security risk. In the meantime, you can generate your addresses using this site and import them into your wallet.

          <h2 id="howtobemoresecure">How to be more secure?</h2>
          <p>If you're looking for the <span class="b">ultimate approach</span>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Download a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD">live disc</a> and compare it's checksum to original source. </li>
            <li> Boot your machine from a live disc.</li>
            <li> Load OfflineAddress.com.</li>
            <li> Disconnect from internet (unplug all network cables, turn off WiFi and Bluetooth, and turn on airplane mode if you have it).</li>
            <li> Generate addresses and print them out.</li>
            <li> Restart your machine.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><span class="b">Using existing operating system:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Make sure you have the newest and updated antivirus software.</li>
            <li> Make sure your operating system isn't (and wasn't ever) infected.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="b">Other important considerations:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Use your own internet connection which isn't shared with other people.</li>
            <li> Make sure you're behind secure firewall.</li>
            <li> Use your own private device.</li>
            <li> Try to use only open source software.</li>
            <li> Print QRcodes/keys/notes instead of copying them (some viruses steal user's clipboard content).</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Why do I get two addresses for each private key imported into my wallet?</h2>
          <p class="remove-bottom">For each private key there is one public key, which it used to define public address.
          </p>
          <p>However, there are two standard formats for writing down public keys, compressed and uncompressed format (from mathematical perspective those are two different way to define the same thing). Since your wallet software doesn't know which format was used, it uses both of them. This site generates uncompressed format of public keys in order to be compatible with older clients.
          </p>
          <h2>Is this site better then BitAddress.org?</h2>
          <p class="remove-bottom">BitAddress.org is a great site, and it's capable of creating fairly secure addresses (better then most bitcoin clients today).
          </p>
          <p>If you used it before, please continue using it (or at least donating to it). This site isn't created to steal users from BitAddress.org.
          </p>
          <h2>Is this site discussed somewhere?</h2>
          <p class="remove-bottom">There is a discussion on BitcoinTalk.org: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=399452">bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=399452</a>.
